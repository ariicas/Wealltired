Inheritance:
in java is a mechanism by which one class inherit properties/methods of another class/
it helps reduce the duplicate code.
if not used properly the classes will be tightly couples and in the future if you have to change anything
in the parent class all of the child classes will be effected.
private fields/methods and constructor do not participate in inheritance.
Single inheritane (not used commonly)
hierachical :
we have one parent class many child classes that inherit from that single parent class.
MultiLevel inheritance:
we have inheritance relationship with more than one class in same hierachy ;
for example ---> c->b->a
multiple inheritance- (not supported by java)
in multiple inheritance  one class inherits from at least 2 class thats creates
the famous diamond problem(both parent classes have the same methods or fields)
if theres a conflit between both parents and causes confusion.
=========================================================
super keyword is used to access constructor
fields and methods of the parent class.
